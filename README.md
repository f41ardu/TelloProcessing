# Tello-Processing (Experimental Branch) 

## Introduction

This is the seed to a collection of Processing-based sample code that interact with the Ryze Tello drone.

If you are not familar with Processing check https://processing.org first. 

"Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for 
learning how to code within the context of the visual arts."

This package is devloped on an Raspberry 3+.

## Project Description

You will find different sample programs based on the tello sdk Tello SDK Documentation EN_1.3_1122.pdf 
and Processing.  

We will start with a simple proof of concept. 

- **TelloTest**

 In TelloTest,You can send a couple of wellknow commands from the keyboar like command, takeoff, land, and so on.  

- **NewTello** 
  
 Use JTello (https://github.com/gnamingo/jTello/blob/master/JTello.java) from gnamingo, all command and all set and 
 read commands are working. JTello.java need some minor modifications to be reused as processing.pde.

- **Video**

  Next thing to come is to read incomming video data. 

## Environmental configuration

The sample code above is based on Processing 3.4. And you need to install the UDP library for Processing 
from http://www.ubaa.net/shared/processing/udp/

Specific to the content and description of each package, you can refer to the readme file in the related folder.
